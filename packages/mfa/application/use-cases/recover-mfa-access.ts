/**
 * Last-resort recovery for a user who has lost access to all enrolled MFA
 * methods and exhausted their backup codes.
 *
 * ## Why this is not self-service
 *
 * Every MFA recovery path is a potential MFA bypass in disguise. The classic
 * real-world attack is social-engineering a support agent into "helping" an
 * attacker recover access, so this flow deliberately requires a strongly
 * authorized, audit-logged action by a *different* principal rather than a
 * convenient unauthenticated reset. The authorization check is a port
 * (`MfaRecoveryAuthorizer`), and the actor identity is always recorded.
 *
 * ## What recovery does — and does not do
 *
 * 1. **Clears every enrolled method** (active, pending, and disabled) instead of
 *    silently reactivating or deleting only the active ones. A leftover pending
 *    method whose secret the attacker already saw would otherwise survive.
 * 2. **Revokes all active sessions** as a precaution: the lost device may still
 *    hold a live session, and recovery must not leave it usable.
 * 3. **Returns the user to a re-enrollment state.** Because no method remains,
 *    an enforcement policy of `required` (see `MfaEnforcementPolicy`) reports
 *    `requiresEnrollment`, forcing re-enrollment on next login — recovery
 *    cannot be used to end up with *less* MFA than before.
